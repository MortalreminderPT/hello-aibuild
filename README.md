## Hello AIBUILD

Here are 2 of my test questions answers, the answers to the Coding Test are in the `./coding-test/` folder.

Similarly, the solutions for the Research Test questions are located in the `./research-test/` folder.

You can check out the documentation to see my thoughts during the process of completing tests and how to test and check my projects.

Best Regards,

PT
